		<h1 class="mb-6">Hi, I'm Bala.</h1>
		<p class="mb-4 leading-6">
			I'm a self-taught developer with a formal education in Physics from
			IIT Bombay. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Amazon. This
			is my personal blog where I write about different projects I'm
			working on. My current interests are Databases and Distributed
			Systems, though I occasionally delve into User Interfaces and
			Design.
		</br></br>
		    Outside of tech, I enjoy spending time bouldering or cooking. I am also a big fan of horror, particularly the works of Junji Ito and H.P. Lovecraft.
